        <p>
        I am a CS grad student at SUNY Binghamton, an aspiring software engineer, a problem-solver and a baker. My skills include Ruby, Rails, Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, MySQL and Git. I have had industry experience in automated testing using Selenium, a bit of Java and Cucumber at Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions where I worked with clients like Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, Nissan and NCR.

        Being a budding open-source contributor, I spend my weekends working on beginner-friendly issues in shf-project from AgileVentures, ifme project and other repositories on GitHub which allow me to build up the confidence to contribute more (waiting eagerly for HacktoberFest!)

        I am a member of <a href = "https://linktr.ee/breakingbarriers">Breaking Barriers in Tech</a>, a very nurturing and inclusive community which aims to combat obstacles faced by minorities in tech. We are building a strong unified community through informative workshops, fun events and such. I am also a registered mentor at the mentorship program at <a href = "https://www.lotusstemm.org/">LotusSTEMM</a>, an organization that is working to provide a networking and leadership platform for South Asian women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and Medicine.

        During my free time, I work on cool side projects to solve problems that I face every day. Currently, I am working on building a Chrome extension called TinyNotes, which is a basic note-taking app that would stay on my new tab window built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I have also recently joined as a volunteer at <a href = "https://www.womenwhocode.com/python">Women Who Code Python track</a> to help with slack channel moderation and event co-ordination. I try to add value to young, aspiring software engineers such as myself by writing out tiny technical posts at <a href="https://dev.to/">dev.to</a>, which is an incredibly talented community that I came across some time ago.
